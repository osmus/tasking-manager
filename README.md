# OSMUS Tasking Manager

This is the [OpenStreetMap US](https://openstreetmap.us) (OSMUS) fork of [hotosm/tasking-manager](https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager), a tool for coordinating [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org/about) mapping campaigns. Check out the live instance at https://tasks.openstreetmap.us.

The OSMUS Tasking Manager incorporates a number of changes to better serve mapping efforts in the United States (though it's also open to the global community). Notably, [Public Domain Map](https://publicdomainmap.org) projects are integrated alongside OpenStreetMap projects, allowing mappers to browse and contribute to government mapping campaigns.

The original Tasking Manager is a project of the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://www.hotosm.org) and is Free and Open Source Software.
